Hi <%= @speaker.given_name %>,

unfortunately we haven't found a slot at the Akademy contributor's conference
2008 for the presentation you proposed with the title

  <%= @presentation.title %>
  
There is the option to put it into a BoF session during the coding marathon
week. If you want to make use of this please let us know or arrange for it
at the event.

We are still looking forward to see you at Akademy, If you have any
questions please feel free to contact us.

For the Akademy 2008 conference program committee,
