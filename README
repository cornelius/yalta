# Yalta - conference planning application

This is the stub for a conference planning application. It was used a couple
of years ago for planning Akademy as an internal tool. The code base here
represents a first stab at making it work again with a current Rails version.

Treat the code as broken for now, don't expect it to work without some serious
polishing.

Yalta serves as a planning tool for a conference program committee. It features:

* Submitting presentation proposals
* Commenting and rating of proposals
* Creating a conference schedule
* Manage conference tracks
* Assigning presentations to slots in the schedule
* Manage speaker information including photos
* Provide overview about missing data
* Export to a static HTML schedule

Most of it works, but there are some remaining issues due to the incomplete port
to current Rails.

If you have any questions or comments, please let me know.
